# Message Retriever Smart Contract

## Background

The smart contract in this repository is part of a 15 day smart contract building challenge. The challenge has three levels of difficulty, namely:

- Basic: The challenges from Day 1 to Day 5
- Intermediate: The challenges from Day 6 to Day 10
- Advanced: The challenges from Day 11 to Day 15

## Challenge Task: Basic 1

Write a smart contract that can store and retrieve a message. The message should be a string variable that can be set by the contract owner or anyone who calls the contract. The contract should also have a function to get the current message.
